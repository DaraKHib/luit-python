# luit-python

Welcome to the **LUIT-PYTHON** repository!

This repo is part of our learning journey as we dive into Python for the very first time. All scripts and practice exercises that we work on will be committed here as we explore and grow our skills step by step.

Feel free to follow along, learn with us, and celebrate the progressâ€”every line of code is a step forward!
