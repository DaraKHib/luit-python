# luit-python

Welcome to the **LUIT-PYTHON** Level Up In Tech repository!

This repository is dedicated to my journey as I dive into Python for the first time. All scripts, practice exercises and projects that I work on will be committed here to track progress, reinforce learning, and build a portfolio of Python projects.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn the fundamentals of Python programming
- Practice writing clean, readable code
- Apply Python to DevOps and AWS-related tasks
- Build confidence working with real code examples
- Create a reference for future Python use in technical roles
